# RiskAssess
This webapp was developed using Flask Web Framework. The models used to predict the diseases were trained on large Datasets.
Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

The primary goal is to develop a prediction engine which will allow the users to check whether they have diabetes or heart disease sitting at home. The user need not visit the doctor unless he has diabetes or heart disease, for further treatment. The prediction engine requires a large dataset and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of the disease. Pre-processing the dataset to train the machine learning models, removing redundant, null, or invalid data for optimal performance of the prediction engine.
